## Overview
Welcome to the Full Sail project repository! This project, originally forked from bethel-school-of-technology/team-the-ghost-kids-on-the-block-frontend, was inspired by team member Mason's idea to track personal financials after paying off college tuition. It was created from scratch using the full stack knowledge gained while attending Bethel School of Technology. For the frontend design we used Angular and Angular Material while the backend uses Google's cloud Firebase and Firestore. Feel free to explore the code, contribute, and make this project even better.
